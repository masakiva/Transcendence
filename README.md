# Transcendance

This project is the very first web project we had to do at 42 Paris, and the last of the common core. We were required to build a Pong with online features, as a single page app.

## Features

- A [Pong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong) game based on the original arcade game released in 1972, with PvP and PvE modes.
- A social interface, to display and manage your friends list, show friends' status etc.
- A messaging interface with private chats, and public / private channels.
- A leaderboard with the highest scores.

## Built With

* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) (a [React](https://reactjs.org/) framework) - Frontend
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) with [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) - Backend
* [PostGreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - Database
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
